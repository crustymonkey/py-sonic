INSTALL
-------------

Installation is fairly simple.  Just do the standard install as root:

# tar -xvzf py-sonic-*.tar.gz
# cd py-sonic-*
# python setup.py install

-------------
USAGE
-------------

This library follows the REST API almost exactly (for now).  If you follow the 
documentation on http://www.subsonic.org/pages/api.jsp or you do a:

$ pydoc libsonic.connection

-------------
BASIC TUTORIAL 
-------------

This is about as basic as it gets.  We are just going to set up the connection
and then get a couple of random songs.

-------------
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pprint import pprint
import libsonic

# We pass in the base url, the username, password, and port number
# Be sure to use https:// if this is an ssl connection!
conn = libsonic.Connection('https://music.example.com' , 'myuser' , 
    'secretpass' , port=443)
# Let's get 2 completely random songs
songs = conn.getRandomSongs(size=2)
# We'll just pretty print the results we got to the terminal
pprint(songs)
-------------

That is about as basic as it gets, but as you can see, it's really
pretty simple.  If you use the documentation provided in the library:

$ pydoc libsonic.connection

or the api docs on subsonic.org (listed above), you should be able to make use
of your server without too much trouble.

-------------
TODO
-------------

In the future, I would like to make this a little more "pythonic" and add
some classes to wrap up the data returned from the server.  Right now, the data
is just returned in the form of a dict, but I would like to have actual
Song, Album, Folder, etc. classes instead, or at least an alternative.  For
now, it works.
